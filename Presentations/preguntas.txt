- It is always P the easy way and not in P hard?
    It is reasonable to say that, and there's even a famous scientist called Cobham 
    that claimed in his thesis that asumption. But, being generally true, at least in
    theory, it doesn't make it certain in practice, where you can find huge constant
    factors that complicates a lot the compute of the problem.

- What would be better? To prove NP = P or NP != P?
    Without any doubts, the first one. If we can demonstrate that P = NP, we could
    improve a lot of methods for solving problems in NP, that could lead us to an
    incredible ammount of new discoverys. Actually, the prize given by Clay institute,
    is related to this.

- Is there any solution to the problem P vs NP?
    Despite the problem is usually considered unsolved, there are some claimed solutions.
    There are more than one hundred attempts to solve it but none of them are consitents
    enough to fully asure that te problem is completely solved.
